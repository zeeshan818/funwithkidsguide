      <h1>About Fun With Kids Guide</h1>
      <p>
        Fun With Kids Guide was started in 2024 by Chicago parents who wanted to help families discover the best things to do in the city and suburbs. Every activity, park, and event listed on our site is reviewed for quality and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: Make planning amazing days out with your kids easier, less stressful, and more fun. We welcome suggestions, reviews, and photos from the community!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for supporting a local resource made by and for Chicago families.
